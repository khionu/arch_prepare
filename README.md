# Arch Prepare

This is my installer for Arch Linux. I hope it helps you.

## Goals

- Install Arch from stock ArchISO
- Automatically setup via user-provided configurations
  - Formatting drives, setting up the DE, starting snapshot/backup timers, etc
- Work on personal devices as well as VMs and servers
